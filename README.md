# Adult Income Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the Adult Income Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary objective is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on various demographic features such as age, education, occupation, and more.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, performed feature encoding, and normalized the data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations to explore the relationships between features and the target variable, helping to identify significant patterns and insights.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Implemented classification algorithms to predict income levels, including model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to predict income levels with a high degree of accuracy. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for socio-economic studies and policy-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data, preprocessing steps, visualizations, and model implementations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adult-income-analysis.git
cd adult-income-analysis
jupyter notebook
